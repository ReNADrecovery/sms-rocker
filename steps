Below is a basic Python script that you can use to pull data from Google Sheets and send SMS messages via the Messages app on your MacBook using Automator.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
First, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You'll need `gspread` to interact with Google Sheets and `pyobjc` to interface with the Mac's Messages app.

```bash
pip install gspread oauth2client pyobjc-framework-ScriptingBridge
```

### Step 2: Google Sheets Setup
Set up your Google Sheets API credentials to access your Google Sheets data. Follow the official Google Sheets API documentation to create credentials and download the `credentials.json` file. Save this file in the same directory as your Python script.

### Step 3: Python Script

```python
import gspread
from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials
from ScriptingBridge import SBApplication
import time

# Google Sheets setup
scope = ["https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"]
creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('credentials.json', scope)
client = gspread.authorize(creds)

# Open the Google Sheet by name
sheet = client.open("Your Google Sheet Name").sheet1

# Fetch all phone numbers and messages
contacts = sheet.get_all_records()

# Access Messages app on Mac
messages_app = SBApplication.applicationWithBundleIdentifier_("com.apple.iChat")

# Loop through contacts and send messages
for contact in contacts:
    phone_number = contact['Phone Number']
    message_text = contact['Message']

    # Create a new outgoing message
    outgoing_message = messages_app.outgoingMessages().objectAtIndex_(0)
    outgoing_message.content = message_text
    outgoing_message.recipients = [phone_number]

    # Send the message
    outgoing_message.send()
    
    # Pause to avoid sending too fast
    time.sleep(1)

print("All messages have been sent!")
```

### Step 4: Run the Script
- Run this script on your MacBook.
- It will fetch phone numbers and corresponding messages from your Google Sheet and send each message through the Messages app on your MacBook.

### Important Notes:
- **Google Sheets API**: Ensure your Google Sheets are properly set up with API access.
- **Messages App**: The `SBApplication` interface requires the Messages app to be configured correctly on your MacBook.
- **Rate Limiting**: Adjust the `time.sleep(1)` to control the sending speed and avoid rate-limiting issues.

This script assumes that you have set up everything correctly, including Google Sheets API credentials and the necessary Python environment on your MacBook.
